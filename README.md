# QuasaScale Backend (Headscale API on steroids)

## Overview

The **QuasaScale Backend** is a powerful extension for [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale), designed to enhance its functionality by providing additional APIs to simplify and extend its capabilities. This project is built using **Bun**, **Hono**, and **TypeScript**, offering a robust, modern, and efficient backend system for Headscale.

If you're looking for an advanced, feature-rich, and high-performance API extension for your Headscale setup, **QuasaScale Backend** is exactly what you need.
Actually it is meant to be used with its frontend [QuasaScale ](https://github.com/reyzzz/quasaScale)
